#List Slicing Method

#2nd Approach : m*n time complexity
'''The idea is simple. Consider each array element X[] and ignore it if it is already in the correct order (i.e., the element smallest among all remaining elements); otherwise, swap it with the smallest element, which happens to be the first element of Y[]. After swapping, move the element (now present at Y[0]) to its correct position in Y[] to maintain the sorted order.'''

    m = len(X)

    # Consider each element `X[i]` of list `X[]` and ignore the element if it is
    # already in the correct order; otherwise, swap it with the next smaller
    # element, which happens to be the first element of `Y[]`.
    for i in range(m):
 
        # compare the current element of `X[]` with the first element of `Y[]`
